# Stegasauras
Stegasauras provides services for steganography in images. Stegasauras gives you the possibility to specify a custom text message that you want to encrypt and hide it in a custom picture and also provides services to decode a hidden message from an image. Stegasauras is an application built specifically for helping users hide sensitive data inside images in only a few steps. Stegasauras accomplishes the task very quickly and without errors throughout the entire process. 
## Image Steganography
Image steganography is the process of hiding a secret message within an image such that someone can not know the presence or contents of the hidden message. The purpose of Steganography is to maintain secret communication between two parties. Our steganography software tool allows a user to embed hidden data inside an image or video, and later extract that data.
### Encoder
Our steganographic encoder conceals any text message in an image in a secure way and sends it without suspicion.
### Decoder
Our steganographic decoder decodes a hidden message from a steganographic image in a secure way.
